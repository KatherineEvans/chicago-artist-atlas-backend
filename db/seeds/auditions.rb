But he’s not prepared for the rigorous local edicts, including a ban on dancing instituted by the local preacher, who is determined to exercise control over the town’s youth. When the reverend’s rebellious daughter sets her sights on Ren, her roughneck boyfriend tries to sabotage Ren’s reputation, with many of the locals eager to believe the worst about the new kid. The heartfelt story that emerges pins a father longing for the son he lost against a young man aching for the father who walked out on him. To the rockin’ rhythm of its Oscar and Tony-nominated Top 40 score, augmented with dynamic new songs, Footloose celebrates the wisdom of listening to young people while guiding them with a warm heart and open mind.", additional_notes: nil, audition_address_id: audition_address.id , audition_date1: "2024-05-20", audition_time1: "6:00PM-9:00PM", audition_date2: "2024-05-21", audition_time2: "6:00PM-9:00PM", audition_date3: nil, audition_time3: nil, audition_date4: nil, audition_time4: nil, audition_date5: nil, audition_time5: nil, callback_address_id: callback_address.id , callback_date1: "2024-05-23", callback_time1: "6:00PM-9:00PM", callback_date2: nil, callback_time2: nil, callback_date3: nil, callback_time3: nil, in_the_room: nil, materials_to_prepare: "In-Person Auditions: Plan to be there for about an hour.

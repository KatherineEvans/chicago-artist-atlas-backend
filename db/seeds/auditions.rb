Burlesque is a literary, dramatic or musical work, and in this production is intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. This is done through choreographed movement, dance, and includes striptease. Please consider the following information before auditioning for this piece: I understand that this show is a burlesque/theatre hybrid, and while there is no full nudity, I will be asked to remove clothing in a choreographed manner as part of the show. I understand the company provides designed pasties to cover my nipples (including areola), regardless of my gender. I will be instructed on how to apply pasties so that they are secure and comfortable. There will be no exposure of genitals, but I understand that my costume may include exposure of my buttocks. Furthermore, I understand the company will provide guidance on intimate items for covering genitals beneath my costume, which I am responsible for purchasing, including but not limited to safety thongs and body tape. The company will provide appropriate lotions and cream for the protection of the performers skin. Nudity will be gradually incorporated into rehearsal so that I can work at my own pace, but the full expression of the movement and costume will be required shortly before tech begins. I feel comfortable with this material, or I am confident that I will be comfortable by a week before public performances begin.", show_description: "The Buttcracker: A Nutcracker Burlesque© tells the story of Clara, the admin of a corporate office where conforming is to be expected and anyone who deviates is looked down upon.

After battling rats along with her real-life confectionary Buttcracker, Clara is introduced to the colorful characters who inhabit this sexy, raucous underworld, and ultimately learns that self-expression and sexual desires are nothing to be ashamed of, and that there is a home for those who subvert the system of conformity.", additional_notes: nil,

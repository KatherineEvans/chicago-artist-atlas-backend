Rather than trying to reach a certain number of images, or limiting you to certain number of looks we’re only concerned with getting you so many awesome shots that your job of choosing just one will be an extremely difficult one. Whether that takes two hours or two days doesn't matter to us. But it won't take two days. We promise. This also includes almost ALL* of your session images for you to access and download from a private, on-line proofing folder (we can also burn them onto a CD or a thumb drive just ask). All of the images will be adjusted (for brightness and color), and more importantly; high resolution jpegs - ready to take to the printers! We'll provide you with two folders. One folder will have all the images from the session and the second folder will contain our FAVORITES, so you have a place to start when looking at so many pictures of your gorgeous self. :)", logo: "https://res.cloudinary.com/dzlaaytu7/image/upload/v1687228718/Business%20Resource%20Logos/Headshots/popio_stumpf_jivwgy.jpg", free_tier: false})
